By digging through 10 layers of rock, the team hopes to reach rocks from the Cretaceous period, the layer known as the Cretaceous System, which dates back 145 million years. The project, which opened its doors on Tuesday, could be used to identify mineral resources and to help assess environmental risks such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The hole, while extraordinarily deep, will not be the deepest man-made hole on Earth. That title goes to Kola Superdeep Borehole, on the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. The project, which lasted from May 24, 1970, immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union, saw the deepest branch of the hole reach 11,034 meters below sea level. The team found that rocks deep beneath the Earth were much wetter than they expected. Before the well, scientists thought that water would not permeate the rock so deep. They also expected to find a layer of basalt under the continent's granite, as this is what was found in the oceanic crust. Instead, they discovered that beneath the igneous granite was metamorphic granite. Because the continental crust was granitic to the core, this was evidence of plate tectonics, a theory that had only recently begun to be accepted when they began digging the well.

An American team in the 60s reached 183 meters below the seabed, crossing 13 meters of basalt in the most upper layer of oceanic crust before the project was canceled due to mismanagement and financial problems. Apart from these problems, the task is still a huge undertaking. "The difficulty of building the drilling project can be compared to a big truck traveling on two thin steel cables," Sun Jinsheng, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, told China's state news agency Xinhua about China's latest efforts. The earth's crust, on land, is variable. On average it has a thickness of about 30 kilometers, although under the mountain ranges it can reach up to 100 kilometers.
