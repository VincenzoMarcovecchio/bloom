At the end of the twentieth century, geologists began to notice a strange layer deposited in ancient rocks around the world.

A team studied a layer of siliclastic sedimentation deposited in carbonate in Eastern Apli. Meanwhile, in the UK, geologist and forensic scientist Alastair Ruffell examined a layer of grey rock found inside the famous red stone discovered in the area. Both discoveries, along with others, suggested one thing: About 232 million years ago, Earth left a period of long drought and began to rain continuously. To prove it is the presence of gray sandstone and siliclastic sediment that have been deposited for a very long period representing evidence that right at the beginning of the age of dinosaurs, when their number and their diversity increased dramatically, there was an unusually wet period lasting 1-2 million years. In fact, since the discovery, there has been growing evidence that the wet period may have been "the trigger that allowed dinosaurs, and perhaps other members of modern terrestrial fauna, to diversify and dominate the Earth." The period, known as the Carnic Pluvial Event, or even Carnic Crisis, has since been seen in rocks around the world. The cause of the unusual amount of precipitation appears to be the result of a massive increase in humidity, likely due to a giant volcanic eruption in Wrangellia Large Igneous Province, stretching from south-central Alaska and along the coast of British Columbia. "The eruptions peaked in the Carnico," Jacopo Dal Corso, who was involved in research on the eruption, told Everything Dinosaur. "I was studying the geochemical signature of eruptions a few years ago and identified some massive effects on the atmosphere around the world. The eruptions have been huge, pumped out large amounts of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and there have been peaks of global warming."

Pangaea – the supercontinent on Earth at the time – was already subject to monsoons caused by moist air from the seas blowing towards the mainland, where it cools and falls in the form of heavy rains. "As the seas warmed during this period," paleoenvironment researcher Paul Wignall told New Scientist, "a significant amount of moisture would have been produced above it, causing more monsoons and heavier rains on land." The wet and wet period was not an exceptional event for life. A study published in the Journal of the Geological Society paints it as a time when "volcanic eruptions generate acid rain and greenhouse gases, which in turn lead to extinction by thermal shock, destruction of vegetation and soil on land, anoxia and ocean acidification." But in the end, there were clear winners. "In the wake of extensive extinctions of plants and key herbivores on land, dinosaurs were apparently the main beneficiaries in the later period, rapidly expanding in diversity, ecological impact (relative abundance), and regional distribution, from South America initially, to all continents," the team wrote in the publication. "It may have been one of the most important events that favored the advent of dinosaurs, but also of the key clades that still make up modern terrestrial fauna such as lysamphibians, turtles, crocodiles, lizards and mammals."
