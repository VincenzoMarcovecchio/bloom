<blockquote>The Izu-Ogasawara Trench off Japan is not as deep as the famous Mariana Trench, but apparently the fish here survive at considerably greater depths.</blockquote>

<p>The fish were spotted more than 8 kilometers below the surface of the ocean and filmed even deeper. Not only does this break the record for deep-sea fishing, but the team in charge believes they are approaching the maximum depths at which fish can be found. On the western edge of the Pacific Ocean lies a series of trenches up to 11,000 meters deep where the Pacific plate, typically 4,200 below the surface, sinks beneath various continental plates. It was here, in the Izu-Ogasawara Trench, where scientists filmed an unknown species of Pseudoliparis, a type of snailfish, at an incredible depth of 8,336 meters, beating the previous record for the deepest fish found at 8,178 meters in the famous Mariana Trench. The Mariana Trench is the deepest known trench, and therefore the most studied, but it may not be the most interesting, biologically speaking. "Everyone thinks depth is the most important thing in these pits," said Professor Alan Jamieson of the Minderoo-UWA Deep Sea Research Center, who led the expedition. Although depth, and the immense pressure it entails, really shapes life in these environments, it's not the only factor. "Temperature can also be important," Jamieson added.</p>

<p>The Izu-Ogasawara is warm, and therefore more hospitable for life at a greater depth. The team was right with the sighting of Pseudoliparis belyaevi at 8,022 meters deep and footage of the same genus but unknown species at 8,336 meters. The fact that snailfish have adapted to depths greater than any other vertebrate can survive is intriguing because they are generally not deep-sea fish. Most snailfish live in shallow water such as estuaries. At these depths, fish weighing 20-25 centimeters live mainly on small crustaceans.</p>
