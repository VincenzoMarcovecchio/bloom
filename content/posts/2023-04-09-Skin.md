It could be the elixir of life that reported in a study in England. Through a partial genetic reprogramming, it would be possible to rejuvenate skin cells, pushing the hands of the clock by thirty years. The data, which opens up new scenarios regarding regenerative medicine and the fight against aging, have been published in <a target="_blank" href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/71624">eLife by the Babraham Institute</a>. Experts have managed to restore the function of epidermal cells, known as fibroplasts.

The technology used by the experts was created by Nobel Prize winner Shinya Yamanaka, now revisited and corrected. A cocktail of rejuvenating proteins (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and cMyc, also known as Yamanaka factors), was administered to the cells for a period of 13 days instead of the classic 50. In this way, the various signs of age and, for a certain period, also their identity disappeared in the cells, reprogrammed. Grown in laboratory conditions they have regained their identity as skin cells (through a still obscure mechanism) they return to produce collagen just as it happens to younger skin cells.
